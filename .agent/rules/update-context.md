If you are an AI agent working on this repository, you MUST keep `.agent/rules/project-context.md` file updated:
1. If you add/update dependencies, update "Technology Stack"
2. If you add/update entities, update "Data Model Overview"
3. If you change project structure, update "Project Structure"
4. If you add/remove integrations, update "External Integrations"

*You should perform these updates even when just refactoring or fixing bugs, 
if the context changes.*
